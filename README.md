## Project Overview: UFO Sightings with JavaScript
In this module, you will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a 
JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based 
on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: VS code

## Objectives
- Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript “standard” and JavaScript version ES6+. 
- Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases. 
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions. 
- Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions. 
- Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop). 
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Summary
ECMAScript. It sounds as alien as the UFOs Dana is researching. ECMAScript, also referred to as “ES,” 
is a scripting language designed to help standardize JavaScript. This means that ES provides guidelines
and rules for JavaScript to follow, such as how a function should
be created to run correctly, also known as the proper syntax.

## Challenge  Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:
- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
- Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Instructions
Include five total filters in the table:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

## Additionally:
- Create a new function that will replace your handleClick(); function.
- Create an if-else statement to add filter data from input
- Create a filterTable(): to loop through all of the filter and kkeep any data that matches filter values
- Rebuild table calling the builTable(); function
- Use d3.selectAss();
